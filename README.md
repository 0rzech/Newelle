# Assistant

This repository contains a chat bot program written in GTK4 and Adwaita (adw) that allows you to interact with your system and perform various commands. The bot utilizes Baichat and the API from Bavarder (https://bavarder.codeberg.page/) for unlimited and free communication.

## Functionality

The chat bot offers a range of functionalities, including:

1. Image manipulation:
   - Creating clean images
   - Basic image editing operations

2. File and folder management:
   - Creating folders and files
   - Viewing and deleting files and folders
   - Moving and sorting files

3. Programming capabilities:
   - Writing programs
   - Basic code execution

4. Communication:
   - Engaging in conversations with the chat bot

Please note that the chat bot primarily relies on simple commands due to its use of an older engine. While it can handle most terminal-based tasks, it may have limitations in more complex operations.

## Security Considerations

- Cautionary warning: The chat bot has system-level access and can potentially cause irreversible damage. Exercise caution while using it.
- Open-source code: The code for the chat bot itself is open-source, but the chat bot being used may have proprietary aspects, which could pose unknown risks.
- Beta testing: This chat bot is currently in beta testing and should be used with care.

Disclaimer: The developers of this project do not take responsibility for any damages caused by the chat bot. Use it at your own risk.
